## Spiral Galaxy Simulation

This project simulates the structure of a spiral galaxy using a 3D scatter plot. The simulation generates star positions based on a spiral pattern and animates the rotation of the galaxy, providing a visual representation of the galaxy in motion.

### Features

- **3D Galaxy Visualization**: The galaxy is visualized in three dimensions using Matplotlib's `3D` plotting capabilities.
- **Spiral Galaxy Generation**: The stars in the galaxy are arranged in a spiral pattern, typical of many observed galaxies.
- **Animation**: The galaxy is animated to simulate rotation, enhancing the visual experience.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

### Code Overview

1. **Importing Libraries**: The necessary libraries (`numpy`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, `FuncAnimation`, and `Axes3D`) are imported.

2. **Figure and Axis Setup**: The 3D plot is set up using Matplotlib's `figure` and `Axes3D` for 3D plotting.

3. **Galaxy Data Generation**: 
   - A spiral galaxy is generated by calculating the positions of stars (`x`, `y`, `z` coordinates).
   - The radial distance of stars follows a power distribution to mimic the density variation across the galaxy.
   - The spiral shape is created by adjusting the angular position (`theta`) of each star.

4. **Plotting**: 
   - The galaxy is plotted using a 3D scatter plot.
   - Customizations include color mapping based on the `z` coordinate and a dark background to enhance the visual effect.

5. **Animation Function**: 
   - The `update` function rotates the galaxy around its axis.
   - The `FuncAnimation` class is used to create the rotation animation.

6. **Display**: The animated galaxy is displayed using `plt.show()`.

### How to Run

To run the simulation, simply execute the Python script. The galaxy visualization will appear, and the animation will start automatically.

```bash
python spiral_galaxy_simulation.py
```

### Customization

- **Number of Stars**: Adjust `num_stars` to change the number of stars in the galaxy.
- **Number of Arms**: Modify `num_arms` to change the number of spiral arms.
- **Rotation Speed**: Change the `interval` parameter in `FuncAnimation` to speed up or slow down the rotation.

### Example Output

Running the script will produce an animated 3D plot of a spiral galaxy, rotating smoothly to simulate a real galaxy's movement.
